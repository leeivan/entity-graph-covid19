# entity-graph-covid19
This project's target is extracting entities and relations among them, then building a graph. 
We used COVID-19 medical literatures, which is from the [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).
## methodology
During proceceed of extracting entities and relations, our implementation took advantage of pre-trained model [BioBERT](https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert)ï¼Œwhich a biomedical language representation model designed for biomedical text mining tasks such as biomedical named entity recognition, relation extraction, question answering, etc.
